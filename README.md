# Soto---python1project

My project is on Instagram users based on date and time posts. The dataset is a mock data I pulled from github. 

Needed to install seaborn and altair.
Use jupyter notebook to write code and test output.
Install voila to view the results on jupyter notebook.
Load mock data as data = pd.read_csv(), just to view the csv file on studio code. 

I transfer the ipynb file to visual studio code from jupyter notebook since it was easier for me to link to github for
the project requirements.

My focus here on the graphs were :
To figure what time on each day there will be likes.
To see if the past likes have any connection with any upcoming posts.
Determine which months have more traffic.

At first I was trying to create a GUI interface so the user can toggle on what data they wanted to see but it wasnt working.
The idea based on visual graphs you can see the when the user post and when users post the most which is mostly
the summer holidays before it and after it, I say one or two months prior and after. During that time in the months, highest posts during the day
were at 7am 9am.
